TheStudy
A dimly lit room. There's a desk in the center, and a locked door to the north. Oh, and a cat.

#
TheLibrary
An expansive room filled with towering bookshelves packed with old manuscripts. And I guess that Ghost in the corner. Wait. Ghost?!
#
TheConservatory
A glass-roofed sanctuary with plants and rare vegetation. There's a few shovels around. I'd say stop and smell the flowers but we're in a hurry, aren't we? Treasure is bound to be here, so take it!!
#
TheBasement
A dark, musty room with low ceilings and old storage crates piled high. The air is damp and cool, with the smell of mold and earth. Let's not stay too long here. Check out the crate in the middle before you go though.
#
TheSecretChamber
A small, hidden room accessed through the concealed passage. A large, ornate chest sits in the center. The t in chest spells treasure.
